**Meet [Kavim](https://kavim.deepelegant.com/)** — the open-source **canvas for brainstorming** with friends (and AIs). Sketch, debate, drop ideas, continue each other’s thoughts, and do it all **privately**, without the chaos of cloud storage or corporate surveillance. 🎨🤝

> Kavim is evolving faster than your group chat’s inside jokes. Your feedback, wild ideas, and bug reports help us shape the future of collaborative creativity. Jump into the Discord or open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/deepelegant/kavim/issues).
> We read everything — sometimes twice — and respond before your coffee gets cold. ☕

## 🌟 Features

**💸 One AI Subscription Is Enough**
Already paying for an AI? Use it here. Connect your existing model and skip the extra “premium” plans.

**👯 Collaborate with Friends & Family**
Brainstorm together in real time

**🧠 Chat with AI & Branch Conversations**
Talk to multiple AIs, follow new threads, and watch ideas evolve on one shared canvas.

**💾 Create & Store Everything Locally**
No clouds. Everything stays right where it belongs — on your device.

**🛡️ Your Data Is Yours (Seriously)**
Your ideas never meet our servers. When you chat with an AI, your data goes _only_ to the model you choose — and that’s it.
